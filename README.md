# gitlet
TLDR: Lightweight recreation of Git, full with staging, commits, and merging (in progress)

This project is a basic version control system developed in Java that mimics essential Git features like adding, committing, and merging files. It was built from the ground up to manage file changes locally, allowing users to track different versions of their work. The project reinforces concepts related to file storage, branching, and managing project history without relying on external libraries or existing Git tools.
